##  Flash Cards

This is a simple CLI written in ruby that simulates a deck of flash cards.
Users can attempt to answer a question, and will recieve feedback based on
their answer. After the last question, users will recieve a total score as well
as a percentage of correct answers for each category.

This is a fork of Turing School of Software & Design's project of the same name,
from mod 1 of their back-end software engineering track.
